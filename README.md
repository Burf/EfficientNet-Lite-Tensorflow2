# EfficientNet-Lite for Tensorflow2

This is an implementation of "EfficientNet-Lite" on Keras and Tensorflow.

The implementation is based on [official implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet/lite).

## Model

- Model
  * Efficientnet-Lite-B0
  * Efficientnet-Lite-B1
  * Efficientnet-Lite-B2
  * Efficientnet-Lite-B3
  * Efficientnet-Lite-B4
- Pre-trained weight
  * Imagenet(The pre-trained weights are converted from [tensorflow_hub](https://tfhub.dev/).)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- tensorflow 2
- keras
- tensorflow_hub (Use the pre-trained weights)
